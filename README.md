My name is Antonio Ramirez, and I go by the nickname Tony. I am taking CIS 106 because it is a requirement for my major, and a lot of valuable information will come with being in this class. I am not too knowledgeable about programming, so I would like to understand it better. I believe this is a necessary skill in most white-collar jobs. Knowing how to use software programs is vital to working in an office-like setting, but understanding how those programs are created allows you to troubleshoot issues or create your own software programs. In an ever-growing digital society, it is crucial to understand the ins and outs of technology, so this class can only benefit any student who chooses to take it. I look forward to learning in this class because most of this material will be new. It takes a long time to master these skills, but this class will be a great place to start learning.
